#Outline

How Inclusive is Their Diversity?
-	As the reader, I want to know how companies are being inclusive with their current diverse employees.  
-	I want to define Diversity & Inclusion separately.
-	Provide general data on races in the workplace based on general job functions from the census.  
-	Show how often companies seem to “fail” when it comes to diversity & inclusion.  Most companies focus or force their efforts on hiring diversity and incorporating the “Rooney rule”, but what happens to the diverse employees once they are a part of the company?
-	I would show the above by giving a company example of Berkshire Hathaway and what they provide in terms of their D&I efforts. 
-	Berkshire Hathaway says that D&I is important but does little to back that statement up with numbers and initiative. 
-	I then want to provide AT&T as an example of a company who is embracing D&I and their efforts along with the numbers that they provide for their readers and anyone learning more about their company.  
-	Lastly, I want to end with some things the reader can look for in a company for D&I and what transparency they should be looking for. 

#Method of Presenting
I plan on presenting my final project in Shorthand as I believe it will be the cleanest method to keep the data and story engaged for the reader.  In addition, I will be using Infogram to create the charts needed for my final project.

#User Research & Project Revisions
Person 1: 
After reviewing my original storyboard, the first person I got feedback from suggested using AT&T as my positive company example and that they would have a lot of data on their Diversity and Inclusion efforts. 
Person 2: 
Suggested using data on the financial aspects of D&I efforts that I company is supporting.  However, it’s even harder to find company financial statements and where they are exactly pledging that money.  
Person 3: 
This person suggested adding more general information on D&I and giving the reader initial information so they have a platform to move from when it comes to navigating this topic. 


#Wireframe
Below is the wireframe I created to showcase the journey that I wanted to take the reader on.  I originally wanted to keep it simple and focus on two companies.  This was to help the reader think of each as a good/bad guy in the story of diversity and inclusion.  However, I want to add more to it and start with definitions of D&I and why they are important based off census data.
