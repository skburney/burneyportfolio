# About Me
Hey Everyone. I am a graduate student at Carnegie Mellon University in the Master of Public Management Program.  I am currently taking a course called Telling Stories with Data.  I'm hoping to continue in my current role or to take on more responsbilities that allow me to use my degree further.

# What I hope to Learn
I hope to learn how to organize and better visualize the data I am using to tell a more accurate story.  

# Porfolio
Stay tuned...This is where all of my data visualizations will go!
