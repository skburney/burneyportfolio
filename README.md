# About Me
Hey Everyone. I am a graduate student at Carnegie Mellon University in the Master of Public Management Program.  I am currently taking a course called Telling Stories with Data.  I'm hoping to continue in my current role or to take on more responsbilities that allow me to use my degree further.

# What I hope to Learn
I hope to learn how to organize and better visualize the data I am using to tell a more accurate story.  

# Porfolio
As I learn, enjoy my visualizations

# Employment by Race Project

The below will take you directly to my visualization site that showcases the employment rate by race.  It took me some time to figure out how I wanted this data to be redistributed and used.  After trying to put all of this data in one bar chart, I knew that I would need to break this out a bit more.  The data I used is dense and has a lot of information that I decided to use. 

I tried to take the chart data and think how it would look great and visually appealing.  Instead of using the tool Flourish, I decided to use a template on Infograms that I could customize based on the data and break it down.  I also ran my original design by partner and co-worker who mentioned great points of not knowing what the data was showing in my Flourish design.  They said it was difficult to tell what was going on and what the data was trying to say.  As mentioned, I completely scraped this design and knew that I would need more than one visualization to showcase all of the information in the source data. My partner also mentioned a graph that I was using in my updated design was not displaying the data in an impactful way.  I scraped it and tried a different graph that displayed the data better.  My co-worker pointed out my use of color and advised me to stay consistent which I made adjustments to. 

Currently, I think my redesign of the data looks clean and appealing.  Sometimes, I don't like having so much autonomy on projects, but this worked in my favor to really showcase the data in the way I saw fit.  I wanted to show how employment impacted each race last year.  I eliminated comparing it to previous years just to keep the data simplified.  I wanted to focus on the more positives which is why there isnâ€™t much showcasing the unemployment rate, however you can still get a sense of those differences based on race.
